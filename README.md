# Utilities for object detection datasets

Will add a complete documentation once I am done with the complete 
development of 
the project.

Basically, I am trying to centralize all the utility functions 
like converting detection dataset from
one formate to another, splitting dataset into desired
train, test and validation splits, etc.
